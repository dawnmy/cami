# cami

cami is a command-line companion for working with [CAMI](https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn/wiki/CAMI-profiling-format) taxonomic profiling tables. It helps you inspect samples, clean and reformat abundances, and prepare subsets for downstream analysis without leaving the terminal.

## Feature overview

- Summarize CAMI files to see which samples, ranks, and taxa are present.
- Preview the top entries of each sample before loading the file into another tool.
- Filter taxa with expressive boolean predicates that reference rank (`r`), sample (`s`), abundance (`a`), taxonomy (`t`/`tax`), and cumulative sums (`c`).
- Fill in missing higher ranks by pulling lineage information from the NCBI taxdump and round abundances to five decimal places.
- Renormalize abundances so that every rank in every sample sums to 100.
- Reorder taxa within each rank, either by abundance (dropping zeroes) or by lineage, to make tables easier to scan.

The repository includes a small demo table at [`examples/test.cami`](examples/test.cami) that you can use with the examples below.

## Installation

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if it is not already available.
2. Clone this repository and build the binary:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/cami.git
   cd cami
   cargo install --path .
   ```
3. Run `cami --help` to confirm the command is available.

You can also invoke subcommands directly with `cargo run -- <command>` while developing.

## Command reference

### `cami list`

Print a per-sample summary that counts how many taxa and how much abundance is assigned to each declared rank.

```text
$ cami list examples/test.cami
Sample: s1
  Ranks: superkingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, strain
  Total taxa: 18
    superkingdom: taxa=1 total=100.000
    phylum: taxa=2 total=100.000
    class: taxa=3 total=100.000
    order: taxa=3 total=100.000
    family: taxa=3 total=100.000
    genus: taxa=3 total=100.000
    species: taxa=3 total=100.000
    strain: taxa=0 total=0.000
...
```

Use this command to ensure the file has the ranks and coverage you expect before diving into more complex operations.

### `cami preview`

Show the first `N` entries per sample (default `5`). This is handy for spot-checking formatting and verifying that the taxonomy paths look correct.

```text
$ cami preview -n 2 examples/test.cami
@SampleID:s1
@Version:0.10.0
@Ranks:superkingdom|phylum|class|order|family|genus|species|strain
@@TAXID  RANK    TAXPATH              TAXPATHSN                                  PERCENTAGE
2        superkingdom 2                Bacteria                                   100
201174   phylum       2|201174         Bacteria|Actinobacteria                    65.67585
...
```

### `cami filter`

Filter taxa with boolean expressions while optionally filling missing ranks and renormalizing abundances. Results are emitted as a valid CAMI table, so you can chain additional commands or redirect to a file.

Common workflow:

```bash
cami filter --fill-up --renorm "s==s1 & r==species & a>=5" examples/test.cami > enriched.cami
```

This keeps species-level entries from sample `s1` that are at least 5% abundant, fills in any missing higher ranks using the NCBI taxonomy, renormalizes each rank to 100%, and writes the output to `enriched.cami`.

#### Expression syntax

Write expressions with `&` (and), `|` (or), and parentheses. Each atom targets one aspect of the data:

| Atom | Purpose | Operators | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | ----- |
| `r` or `rank` | Match entry ranks | `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>` | Uses the order declared by `@Ranks`. `r<=class` keeps class and more specific ranks, while `r>class` keeps more general ranks. Comma-separated lists are allowed with `==`/`!=`. |
| `s` or `sample` | Select samples | `==`, `!=`, `~` | `==` accepts sample IDs, 1-based indices, comma-separated lists, and inclusive ranges (`s==1:3`). `.` or `:` match all samples. Use `s~'regex'` to match IDs with a regular expression. |
| `a` or `abundance` | Compare abundances | `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<` | Values are interpreted as percentages (0â€“100). |
| `t` or `tax` | Test lineage membership | `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<` | Compares against TAXID values. With `--fill-up` or when taxonomy data is available, ancestors are resolved through the NCBI taxdump; otherwise the command inspects `TAXPATH`. Prefix with `!` to negate the result. |
| `c` or `cumsum` | Filter by cumulative abundance | `<=` | Keeps the least-abundant taxa within each rank whose cumulative sum is at most the threshold (again using percentage units). Prefix with `!` to discard those instead. |

Examples:

- `r==species & a>=1` keeps species entries that are at least 1% abundant.
- `s==1,3-5 | s~'^gut'` keeps explicit samples plus any whose IDs start with `gut`.
- `t<=562` keeps entries that fall under *Escherichia coli* (taxid 562) or match the taxid exactly.
- `!c<=2` removes the lowest-abundance taxa per rank whose cumulative total is at most 2%.

When `--fill-up` is supplied, the command downloads the NCBI taxdump (stored under `~/.cami`) if necessary. Use `--from <rank>` to specify which rank to aggregate from when filling and `--to <rank>` to control how far up the lineage to build. Combine `--renorm` to ensure each rank sums to 100 after filtering and filling.

### `cami fillup`

Populate missing higher ranks for every sample using the NCBI taxdump. Abundances are rounded to five decimal places once the hierarchy is filled.

```bash
cami fillup --to-rank family examples/test.cami > with_family.cami
```

If `--to-rank` is omitted, the command fills to the highest rank declared in each sample. Use `--from <rank>` to choose the source rank used for aggregation (defaults to `species` when available).

### `cami renorm`

Renormalize abundances so that the percentages at each rank sum to 100 for every sample. Entries with zero or negative abundances are ignored during scaling, and positive values are rounded to five decimal places.

```bash
cami renorm examples/test.cami > renormalized.cami
```

### `cami sort`

Reorder taxa within each rank for every sample.

- `--abundance` sorts taxa by descending abundance and removes entries whose abundance is exactly zero.
- `--taxpath [taxpath|taxpathsn]` sorts by the lineage strings so related taxa stay together. The default field is `taxpath` when `-t` is passed without a value.

```bash
cami sort --abundance examples/test.cami > sorted.cami
cami sort --taxpathsn examples/test.cami > lineage_sorted.cami
```

## Working with the filter language

Expressions can be combined freely, allowing complex workflows:

- **Focus on a cohort:** `cami filter "s~'^trial_' & r<=genus" table.cami`
- **Drop rare tails:** `cami filter "!c<=2" table.cami`
- **Isolate a lineage:** `cami filter "t<=1224 & r>=phylum" table.cami`
- **Chain post-processing:** `cami filter --fill-up --renorm "r==species & a>=1" table.cami | cami sort --abundance`

Remember that each command reads from stdin when no input path is supplied and writes to stdout by default, making it easy to compose multiple steps.

## Taxonomy data cache

Commands that require lineage information (`filter --fill-up`, `fillup`) download the NCBI taxdump once and cache it under `~/.cami`. Subsequent runs reuse the cached files. You can remove the directory to force a refresh.
